# WARNING: This is a sandbox, not for public consumption
**Sandboxed code is maintained for me and me alone for the purposes of experimentation. No attempt is made at production quality or readability beyond my needs at time of writing.**  
  
If playing with this code, be on the look out for:

- bad (inconsistant/too short/misleading/ect) naming
- redundant code that is never called
- incomprehensible or just plain incorrect comments
- profane debug messages
- overly fragile procedures
